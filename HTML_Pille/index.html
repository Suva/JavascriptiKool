            <p>The roots of Drum 'n Bass can be found in Jungle. The Drum 'n Bass we know today is actually the Techno kinda version of Jungle. Jungle is classified ad dance music and comes forth from (hardcore) breakbeat music from the rave era in the Uk during the 80's. By 1990, at the height of British rave culture, the Amen began to appear in an increasing number of breakbeat hardcore productions. Hardcore emphasized a unique, harsh, aggressive sound that drew strongly from hip-hop and early acid house. It added a hip-hop influence with the addition of breakbeats and increased the tempo. A strong reggae and ragga influence emerged in 1991 and 1992, with uplifting piano melody loops or Jamaican reggae samples used at normal speed layered on top of frenetic 150 to 170 BPM breakbeats. This sound quickly evolved to a point where sliced and diced drum breaks in conjunction with low frequency bass lines became the important features of many tracks. This style was initially referred to as Jungle.</p>
            <p>In response to Jungle, some producers started focusing on darker, more aggressive sounds. Strange noises and effects, syncopated rhythms made from rearranged funk breaks and loud bass lines defined the genre. These tracks were not widely called jungle or drum and bass by the mainstream media at their time of creation (although the terms "jungle" and "jungle techno" were in common use in the rave scene by then, with "drum & bass" appearing here and there on particular mixes of several vinyl releases), but they can nevertheless be found on later jungle and drum and bass compilations. The first major round-up of these tracks which was to use the term 'drum & bass' was probably "The Dark Side - Hardcore Drum & Bass Style": a compilation on React Records, released March 1993. However, as the early nineties saw drum and bass break out from its underground roots and begin to win popularity with the general British public, many producers attempted to expand the influences of the music beyond the domination of ragga-based sounds.</p>
            <p>f you’ve never heard Drum and Bass before, here’s the condensed version: a marriage of sped-up Hip Hop breakbeats with dubby bass lines, overlaid with strong melodies from Techno and House music. The genre’s hype dipped off after a few years, but in the past decade the music industry has seen a dramatic resurgence of this once-beloved genre.</p>
